We wanna create an online piano like the one in https://www.musicca.com/piano.... sort of a mock up of that ... to be able tunes online for fun 
1. Features to Implement:
   - Interactive piano keyboard (88 keys like a real piano)
   - Play notes using mouse clicks and keyboard (computer keys mapped to piano keys)
   - Display which keys are currently pressed/highlighted
   - Volume control and note sustain pedal toggle
   - Visual feedback: show note name on key press
   - Option to switch between simple (1-2 octaves) and full keyboard
   - Responsive design for different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)
   - Select instrument sounds (e.g., piano, organ, synth) if possible
   - Save and share played tunes (record & playback)
   - Dark/Light mode toggle

2. Tech Stack:
   - Frontend: React or Vanilla JS with HTML/CSS (focus on accessibility and performance)
   - Sound: Web Audio API for accurate synthesis or sample playback
   - Optional: Use libraries like Tone.js for easier audio handling, but understand basics
   - Hosting: Deploy as a static site (Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages)

3. Steps to Build:
   a. Design keyboard layout and responsive UI wireframe (Figma/pen-and-paper mockup)
   b. Build interactive UI: render keys, handle input events, highlight keys
   c. Integrate audio: play notes on key press, handle audio overlap/sustain
   d. Map computer keyboard to piano keys (display overlay or reference chart)
   e. Implement advanced features: octave shift, pedal, instrument, recorder
   f. Polishing: responsive CSS, accessibility (keyboard navigation & ARIA)
   g. Testing: cross-browser, mobile, edge cases (quick key presses, multi-touch)
   h. Launch MVP, gather feedback, iterate

4. Stretch Goals:
   - MIDI keyboard support via Web MIDI API
   - Sheet music view/learning mode
   - User accounts to save compositions
   - Backend for saving recordings to cloud (optional)

5. Milestones:
   - [ ] Interactive piano keyboard UI
   - [ ] Basic note playback with Web Audio API
   - [ ] Keyboard input mapping
   - [ ] Responsive design & touch support
   - [ ] Recording & playback features
   - [ ] Polish & deployment
